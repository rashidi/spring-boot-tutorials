== Motivation

While it is common to find https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot[Spring Boot] tutorials on the Internet, it is
challenging to find tutorials that are up-to-date and include automated tests to demonstrate the implementation and
ensure stability.

== Commitment

Continual improvement is fundamental in software development. This repository is committed in ensuring adherence to
best practices and keeping all dependencies up-to-date. The quality of these tutorials and the knowledge imparted is,
and always will be, my primary goal.

With the help of https://github.com/dependabot[Dependabot], each tutorial is also kept up-to-date with the latest
dependencies. Currently, we are using Java https://adoptium.net/en-GB/temurin/releases/?version=21[Temurin 21]
with https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.springframework.boot/3.3.0[Spring Boot 3.3.0].
