Implement validation in Spring Data REST.

== Background

link:https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-rest[Spring Data REST] is a framework that helps developers to build hypermedia-driven REST web services. It is built on top of the Spring Data project and makes it easy to build hypermedia-driven REST web services that connect to Spring Data repositories â€“ all using HAL as the driving hypermedia type.

In this article, we will look at how to implement validation in Spring Data REST.

== Domain Classes

There are two `@Entity` classes, link:{url-quickref}/src/main/java/zin/rashidi/boot/data/rest/book/Author.java[Author] and link:{url-quickref}/src/main/java/zin/rashidi/boot/data/rest/book/Book.java[Book]. Both classes are accompanied by `JpaRepository` classes - link:{url-quickref}/src/main/java/zin/rashidi/boot/data/rest/book/AuthorRepository.java[AuthorRepository] and link:{url-quickref}/src/main/java/zin/rashidi/boot/data/rest/book/BookRepository.java[BookRepository].

While `Author` and `Book` are standard JPA entities, their repositories are annotated with `@RepositoryRestResource` to expose them as REST resources.

== Validation

We will implement a validation that ensures that `Author` in `Book` is not `INACTIVE`. To do this, we will create a custom validator class, link:{url-quickref}/src/main/java/zin/rashidi/boot/data/rest/book/BeforeCreateBookValidator.java[BeforeCreateBookValidator].

include::src/main/java/zin/rashidi/boot/data/rest/book/BeforeCreateBookValidator.java[lines=11..28]
----

As we can see, the validator class implements `Validator` interface and overrides `supports` and `validate` methods. The `supports` method checks if the class is `Book` and the `validate` method checks if the `Author` is `INACTIVE`. Next we will inform Spring about our `Validator` through link:{url-quickref}/src/main/java/zin/rashidi/boot/data/rest/book/BookValidatorConfiguration.java[BookValidatorConfiguration].

----

Now, Spring is aware that the `Validator` will be executed before creating a `Book`.

== Verify Implementation

We will perform a `POST` request to create a `Book` with an `Author` that is `INACTIVE`. The request will be rejected with `400 Bad Request` response.
