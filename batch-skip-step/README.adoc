Skip processing specific data through business logic in Spring Batch.

== Background

Spring Batch is a framework for batch processing â€“ execution of a series of jobs. A job is composed of a series of steps.
Each step consists of a reader, a processor, and a writer. The reader reads data from a data source, the processor
processes the data, and the writer writes the processed data to a data source.

There are scenarios where we want to skip processing specific data through business logic. For example, in this guide,
we want to skip data where `username` are either `Elwyn.Skiles` or `Maxime_Nienow`. We will look into two approaches;
one by returning `null` and another by throwing `RuntimeException`. Both approaches will be implemented in the same
`ItemProcessor`.

Our application will process data from link:{url-quickref}/src/main/resources/users.json[users.json] file and write the processed data
into MySQL database. Content of `users.json` is taken from link:https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users[JSONPlaceholder].

== Implement Logics to Skip Data

=== Returning `null`

First approach is to return `null` from `ItemProcessor` implementation. This approach is straight forward and does not
require additional configuration.

include::src/main/java/zin/rashidi/boot/batch/user/UserJobConfiguration.java[lines=89..90]

With that, when the `Job` detected that the `ItemProcessor` returns `null`, it will skip the data and continue to the next.

=== Throwing `RuntimeException`

Second approach is to throw `RuntimeException` from `ItemProcessor` implementation. This approach requires additional
configuration to be done when defining `Step`.

Implementation in `ItemProcessor` is as follows:

include::src/main/java/zin/rashidi/boot/batch/user/UserJobConfiguration.java[lines=46]
include::src/main/java/zin/rashidi/boot/batch/user/UserJobConfiguration.java[lines=48..49]
include::src/main/java/zin/rashidi/boot/batch/user/UserJobConfiguration.java[lines=89..90]
----

Next is to inform `Step` to skip `UsernameNotAllowedException`:

[source,java]

include::src/main/java/zin/rashidi/boot/batch/user/UserJobConfiguration.java[lines=63..65]
include::src/main/java/zin/rashidi/boot/batch/user/UserJobConfiguration.java[lines=69..73]
----

With that, when the `Job` detected that the `ItemProcessor` throws `UsernameNotAllowedException`, it will skip the data.
Full definition of the `Job` can be found in link:{url-quickref}/src/main/java/zin/rashidi/boot/batch/user/UserJobConfiguration.java[UserJobConfiguration.java].

== Verification

We will implement integration tests to verify that our implementation is working as intended whereby `Elwyn.Skiles` and
`Maxime_Nienow` are skipped thus will not be available in the database.

[source,java]

include::src/test/java/zin/rashidi/boot/batch/user/UserBatchJobTests.java[lines=36..51]
include::src/test/java/zin/rashidi/boot/batch/user/UserBatchJobTests.java[lines=56..76]
include::src/test/java/zin/rashidi/boot/batch/user/UserBatchJobTests.java[lines=143..144]
----

By executing our tests in link:{url-quickref}src/test/java/zin/rashidi/boot/batch/user/UserBatchJobTests.java[UserBatchJobTests.java],
we will see that all users are processed except `Elwyn.Skiles` and `Maxime_Nienow`.
